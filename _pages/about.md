Thank you for visiting my site. Whether you are a researcher, engineer, recruiter, colleague, or simply exploring out of curiosity, I hope you will find content here that is useful.

## About This Website

This website serves as a personal journal and technical archive documenting selected highlights from my research journey. It is also intended as a practical resource for newcomers to hardware design. I aim to provide tutorials and guidance on using open-source toolchains to build computer systems—from FPGA-based prototypes to VLSI-oriented digital design flows.

My hope is that these materials help others understand, experiment with, and extend hardware systems for their own projects. In addition to tutorials, the site also presents an overview of my research activities, particularly in secure computer architecture and hardware-based communication security.

## About Me

I am a PhD student at **The University of Electro-Communications (UEC), Tokyo, Japan**. My research lies at the intersection of computer architecture, hardware security, and energy-efficient system design. My interests include:

- Computer Architecture
- RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC) Design
- Low-Power, High-Performance Accelerators  
  (Post-Quantum Cryptography, Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- Hardware Security Primitives  
  (True Random Number Generators, Physical Unclonable Functions)
- AI and Machine Learning

## Research Focus

Quantum computing introduces significant risks to classical cryptographic standards. While large-scale quantum computers are not yet publicly accessible, their development trajectory suggests that existing security protocols will eventually become vulnerable. Organizations such as [NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography) have initiated the transition toward **post-quantum cryptographic (PQC)** standards to address these threats.

However, deploying PQC on resource-constrained hardware, such as IoT devices, poses major challenges due to the computational complexity of these algorithms compared to traditional cryptography (e.g., AES, ECC, SHA-based constructions). My research investigates a lightweight RISC-V–based systems and examines two complementary directions:
- Evaluating the feasibility of deploying PQC workloads on resource-constrained RISC-V systems, and identifiying minimum architectural modification required to support them.
- Verifying the needs of PQC on different IoT communication settings, and enhancing traditional cryptography with dedicated hardware security primitives.
